# 🏢 Human Resource ETL Project (SQL Server)

This project simulates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using SQL Server for a Human Resource (HR) management system. 
The goal is to load raw HR datasets, clean and transform them, and prepare them for analytics-ready reporting using a layered approach:

- 🟫 Bronze Layer: Raw staging tables
- 🪞 Silver Layer: Cleaned and validated data
- 🥇 Gold Layer: Final reporting data
